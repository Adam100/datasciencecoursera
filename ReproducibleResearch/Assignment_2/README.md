## About
This is the github repo for the second assignment for the Reproducible Research course. The assignment can be viewed on rpubs at [Severe Weather Analysis](http://rpubs.com/mdancho84/severeweathereffectsanalysis).

## Synopsis

This report reviews the effects of severe weather events on both the population and the economy. This is an investigative report in that we are seeking to determine which event types have historically caused the most fatalities (a measure of population impact) and property damage (a measure of economic cost). Data was obtained from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s (NOAA) storm database. The events start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. The conclusion is that tornados cause the most harm to the population in terms of fatalties and floods cause the most economic cost.
